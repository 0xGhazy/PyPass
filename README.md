PyPass Password Manager

<br></div>

# [+] Project Overview.
Remembering passwords for many personal accounts may be a difficult task these days, especially if passwords are constantly increasing, so we present our project `PyPass`.

PyPass password manager is a free open source application to keep all your passwords in one safe place. it's a small password manager for personal useage. we try to improve it.

In this project we try to create a free and opensource application thats respect users privacy. Due to the user's concern over the privacy of his data, especially those sensitive data such as passwords, we try to offer him an easy, simple and secure application that does not manipulate or sell that data in order to make profits.

# [+] Technology in use.

- The core components coded with `Python 3.9`.
- Application themes are purely written in `css`.
- `PyQt5` is used to handle all GUI components and setting its style in `css`.
- Besides `PyQt5` i used `Qt Designer` to design the GUI in an easy way instead of designing it manually using the code.
- `Pyinstaller` for compiling the whole project.
